# industrial_robot_motion_interfaces

This ROS 2 interfaces package aims at providing a message interface to represent robot (as in
manipulators) motions as they are traditionally programmed: A series of primitives such as `LIN`,
`PTP`, `CIRC`.

> [!NOTE]
> This package is currently in an early development stage. Things might change considerably even up
> to the package name itself. If you want to use this package right now, please be aware of that.
> Any suggestions or comments on these interfaces are welcome!
